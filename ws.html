        <h2>Introduction (Chromatography)</h2>
        <p>   Chromatography is an essential analytical technique that enables the separation and identification of components within complex mixtures. This experiment explores the fundamental principles of chromatographic separation, focusing on the differing affinities of substances for stationary and mobile phases. A key aspect of accurately interpreting chromatographic data is the ability to balance chemical equations, ensuring that the number of atoms for each element remains consistent on both the reactant and product sides, in accordance with the law of conservation of mass. This skill is vital when preparing reagents, analyzing reaction products, and ensuring the precision of quantitative results obtained through chromatography.</p>

<p>   This experiment provides practical experience in performing chromatography and develops the skills necessary to interpret chromatograms and balance chemical equations. By identifying individual components within a mixture, a deeper understanding of chromatographic techniques and their significant applications in scientific research and industry, from pharmaceuticals to environmental analysis, will be achieved.
</p>
<h2>Introduction (Molecular Model)</h2>
        <p>    In the following sections, we will describe three molecular models designed for water filtration, focusing on their geometry and interactions with specific contaminants.  Water filters use specially designed molecules to trap different pollutants like salts and organic chemicals. The molecules' sing shape and electrical properties determine which pollutants they attract and remove from the water.  These filters are used in a variety of applications, from purifying drinking water in homes and communities to treating industrial wastewater.
</p>

<p>   These molecular filters are designed with special structures that can attract and trap different pollutants. Some filters have areas that attract water while repelling oil, helping to remove harmful organic chemicals. Others are made to catch heavy metals, salts, or even bacteria. The effectiveness of these filters depends on their surface area, pore size, and electrical properties, which help them target specific contaminants. This ability to customize how the filters interact with pollutants makes them very useful for cleaning water in many different situations

        <h2>Experiment Results (Chromatography)</h2>
        <p>After allowing the paper strip to dry, the colors traveled upwards and separated into distinct bands. Each dye's migration was measured by determining the distance traveled from the baseline to the endpoint after the paper strip was immersed in alcohol for a set duration. For instance, the red dye traveled approximately 2.0 cm in 2 minutes, while the blue dye traveled 1.5 cm in the same timeframe.</p>

<p>    The separation of the dyes from the M&Ms demonstrates how chromatography works. The different distances each dye traveled indicate their unique interactions with the paper and the alcohol. As a result, some dyes traveled farther than others, clearly illustrating the fundamental concept of chromatographic separation.</p>

<p>    The outcome was a little different from the expected results. Based on the reference, the color was still evident, but in the chromatography conducted, the color of the candy was not as visible. The results appeared quickly; only a few minutes were needed before the chromatography results were observed. Strict adherence to the directions was essential to obtain results that matched the reference.
</p>

<h2>Experiment Results (Molecular Geometry)</h2>
  <p>Based on the result that we made, each of the model shows the structure of each compound that we got. Each model shows the number of bonds that the compound has. It also has its love pairs and bond angles that identifies the molecular geometry. As seen in the table on  the data analysis, it shows the results of each compound.</p>

  <p>These models showed us things like how many bonds each molecule has, where the lone pairs of electrons are located, and the angles between the bonds. This information is crucial because a molecule's shape directly affects its properties, like how it might react with other chemicals or its melting point.  Understanding these shapes is very important for designing new medicines and materials with specific characteristics.</p>
 
   <p>To make our analysis even better, we could expand the study to include a much larger variety of molecules.  We could also use more advanced statistical methods to find hidden patterns and relationships in the data.  It would be helpful to compare our computer models to results from real-world experiments, like X-ray crystallography, to ensure accuracy</p>

        <h2>Discussion (Chromatography)</h2>
        <p>In the paper chromatography experiment, different pigments from the color-coated candy were identified and separated. The results revealed four distinct colors: the orange pigment, with an Rf value of 0.36, showed the highest affinity to the solvent; the yellow pigment had an Rf value of 0.32, and the blue pigment had an Rf value of 0.3, both indicating moderate affinity; while the red pigment, with an Rf value of 0.4, indicated low affinity, traveling the fastest and exhibiting less interaction with the stationary phase. Challenges were encountered during the experiment, including inconsistent sample applications, which could have affected the Rf calculations.</p>

<p>In the balancing experiment, the focus was on the process of balancing chemical equations in accordance with the law of conservation of mass. This principle states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, meaning that the number of atoms must remain equal on both sides of the equation. Several equations were balanced to deepen understanding of this concept. It was observed that each balanced equation maintained the same number of atoms. Challenges arose when determining the correct coefficients for the equations.
</p>
<h2>Discussion (Molecular Geometry)</h2>
        <p>    Studying molecular models allows us to determine and visualize the arrangements of molecules and atoms, providing a clearer understanding of their structure. This type of project enhances our ability to create specific visual aids, helping us better grasp complex molecular configurations. Moreover, it deepens our knowledge of molecular structures, offering valuable insights into how atoms interact and form different compounds, which can be crucial for various scientific applications.</p>


   <p>    Moreover, molecular models provide valuable insights into how molecules interact with each other in various chemical reactions. By studying these models, we can predict the outcomes of these interactions and understand how different molecular structures influence a substance’s physical and chemical properties. For example, slight changes in a molecule’s shape or the arrangement of its atoms can drastically affect its reactivity or solubility. This knowledge is crucial in fields such as drug design, where specific molecular shapes are needed to target particular biological pathways, or in materials science, where understanding molecular interactions can lead to the development of new materials with desirable properties..</p>

        <h2>Conclusion (Chromatography)</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this experiment effectively demonstrated the principles of chromatography, emphasizing the roles of the stationary and mobile phases in separating various compounds. Observations provided insights into the behavior of different substances within mixtures, enhancing the understanding of chromatography and its applications in both research and industry.</p>

<p>The importance of balancing chemical equations in chromatography and the relevance of the law of conservation of mass were also recognized. Skills were developed in identifying the components of a mixture and employing proper techniques for their separation. Proficiency in accurately reading chromatograms was achieved. This foundational knowledge enables further exploration of chromatography in various fields, highlighting its significance as a powerful analytical tool.
</p>
<h2>Conclusion (Molecular Geometry)</h2>
        <p> The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) provides a basic understanding of molecular geometry and how it affects the behavior of chemicals. The theory emphasized how important electron pair repulsion is in determining how atoms are arranged within a molecule. The molecule’s shapes and interactions with other molecules are therefore determined by the arrangement.</p>
     <p>   The VSEPR theory's application goes beyond molecular geometry predictions because it provides insights on how molecules' polarity affects their solubility, boiling point, and reactivity. The VSEPR theory also offers a structure for understanding how different molecules interact with pollutants in water filtration. A molecule’s ability to trap particular pollutants is influenced by its shape, size, and polarity, which are all determined by the arrangement of its electron pairs.</p>
  <p>   Furthermore, bonded and lone pairs of electrons will align around the center of an atom in order to maximize their distances from one another and reduce electron repulsion. Bond angles and molecule structure are affected because lone pairs have a more stronger repulsive force than bonding pairs because of their higher electron number
